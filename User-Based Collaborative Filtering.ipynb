    "Collaborative filtering is a method that can be used when building a recommender system. Collaborative filtering is the process of using data about a pool of users to recommend items to a specific user. This collaborative filtering comes in two flavors: user-based or item-based. \n",
    "- **User-based collborative filtering** is when you find users that are similar to a specific user. Then, items that are well-liked by the other users are recommended to the specific user. \n",
    "- **Item-based collaborative filtering** is when you find an item that a specific user likes. With that information, you can find other users who liked the same item and then recommend to the specific user additional items that were liked by the other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at the MovieLens 100k dataset. This is a dataset that has many users and their ratings of various movies. We'll perform user-based collaborative filtering. That is, we will identify users who gave similar movie ratings and then recommend movies that any given user may like and has not yet seen/rated."
